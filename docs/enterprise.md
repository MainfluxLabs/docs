## Downlinks

The Downlink service enables the integration of data from different platforms/services into Mainflux. In a situation where certain platforms do not have a way to send data via Webhook or in some other way, then the Downlink service comes to the rescue.

The Downlink service provides data retrieval from certain services for a previously defined frequency. Downlink configuration offers the possibility of getting data for different frequencies, which are minutely, hourly, daily, and weekly. In addition to frequency-defined recurring fetches, it is possible to fetch one-time data for a specific date and time in the future. 

Downlink service supports retrieval data in `JSON` and `XML` format.
